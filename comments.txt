1. Kernel Smoother: which kernel (gaussian or tricube?)
2. LOWESS: which span? Always .2? .5 with covars!
3. KRLS which kernel? See Code comment #5
4. Which value for gamma_2 > 0?
5. Which value for beta? 1
6. Number of bootstrap samples (K)? 100!?
7. Notation: First stage error epsilon (Eq. 10) or u (Eq. 14)
8. Notation: delta_1 in second stage and delta_2 in first stage (Eqs. 13 & 14)? First-stage coefficient = 0?
9. Notation: IV-Lowess or IV-lowess?
10. Notation: In formula for bootstrapped SEs: 1/K and not 1/k (p. 27 and p. 13).
11. Notation: Section 4.2 not K-dimensional subspace - use different letter because of nr of bootstrap samples
12. No (bootstrapped) SEs for DGP with exogenous covariate? I assume Section 4.4 on SEs uses the "no exogenous covariate" scenario?

CODE:
1. DGP: y=x+2*e - why 2*e?
2. No first-stage error!?
3. z^2 (or z^3) but not z included?
4. No w in first-stage!
5. For kernel: Epanechnikov kernel function (not gaussian or triangular as written in the paper)?

NOTE: I don't have the Appendix
